# Provide detailed explanation of what is the difference between git mv and usual mv ?

While both `git mv` and the standard `mv` command move or rename files, there are key differences in their context and functionality:

**Scope:**

* **`mv`:** Operates **solely on the file system:** it physically moves or renames the file in your local directory. Changes made with `mv` are not tracked by Git version control.
* **`git mv`:** Primarily interacts with **Git's internal tracking and staging mechanism:** it not only moves the file physically but also updates the Git index (staging area) and history. This allows the rename to be tracked and included in future commits.

**Functionality:**

* **`mv`:** Offers basic file movement and renaming. It cannot move directories or handle conflicts during renames.
* **`git mv`:** Provides additional functionalities relevant to version control:
    * **Moving directories:** `git mv` can move entire directories, whereas `mv` only works with individual files.
    * **Conflicting renames:** If a file already exists at the destination path, `git mv` informs you of the conflict and requires resolution through merging or choosing a different name.
    * **Submodule updates:** When moving submodules (Git repositories within another repository), `git mv` updates the submodule configuration automatically to reflect the new location.

**Impact on Version Control:**

* **`mv`:** Changes made with `mv` are **invisible to Git** and won't be reflected in commit history. You need to manually stage and commit the moved file separately using `git add` and `git commit`.
* **`git mv`:** Automatically incorporates the move into the Git workflow. The renamed file is staged and appears in the next commit, reflecting the change in the repository history.

**Summary:**

* **Use `mv` for simple file renaming outside of Git control.**
* **Use `git mv` for renaming files within a Git repository to track the change in version control history.**

**Additional Considerations:**

* `git mv` offers more comprehensive functionality but requires understanding Git concepts like staging and commiting.
* Using `git mv` ensures proper tracking of file movements and simplifies version control management.
* Both commands handle file collisions differently, so be aware of potential conflicts and resolve them appropriately.

Remember, choosing the right command depends on your specific context and version control needs.

I hope this detailed explanation clarifies the differences between `git mv` and the usual `mv` command. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions!
