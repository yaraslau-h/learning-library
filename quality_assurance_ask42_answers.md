# What is a bug?

## what is bug from standpoint of a qa engineer? generate strict answer, how lawyer would do

Here is a strict answer on how a QA engineer might define a bug from a legal perspective:

A bug in software development refers to a defect or error in the code that causes unexpected or unintended behavior. From a QA engineer's standpoint, a bug is a flaw in the software that fails to meet the specified requirements or user expectations. 

Legally, a bug could potentially be viewed as a breach of contract if the software provider had guaranteed a certain level of quality or performance. A lawyer representing a client impacted by software bugs may argue that the presence of defects constitutes a breach of express or implied warranties under contract law.

Specifically, a lawyer could argue that bugs violate the implied warranty of merchantability, which requires software to be reasonably fit for its intended purpose. Bugs that cause software crashes, data loss, or other significant impairment may support a claim that the software fails this basic fitness standard. 

Additionally, bugs could potentially violate express warranties if the software provider promised that the software would perform certain functions in a way that is free of defects. Failing to deliver software that is bug-free in this scenario would constitute a breach of express warranty.

In summary, from a legal perspective, bugs in software may expose providers to breach of contract claims if the bugs are pervasive and severe enough to show the software lacks agreed-upon quality or fails to perform as promised. QA engineers play an important role in identifying and reducing bugs to mitigate this potential legal liability.

## what does a bug report consist of? what fields should it have? generate professional comprehensive explanation

Here is a detailed explanation of what a bug report should consist of and the key fields it should include:

Summary - A short, descriptive title that summarizes the bug. For example "Video fails to load on profile page".

Description - A detailed writeup of the bug. This should include:

- Steps to reproduce - A clear step-by-step description of how to reproduce the bug. This is one of the most important parts of a bug report.

- Expected behavior - What should happen when the steps are followed. 

- Actual behavior - What actually happened when the steps were followed.

- Screenshots/videos - Visual references of the bug occurring.

- Sample code - If applicable, include any code that can help reproduce the issue.

- Frequency - How often does this bug occur? Is it reproducible every time or only sporadically?

- Impact - How severe is the bug? Is it a minor graphical glitch or is it making a key feature completely unusable?

- Workarounds - Are there any temporary workarounds for the bug while it remains unfixed?

Environment - Details about the environment the bug occurred in:

- Operating system and version (e.g. iOS 12.1, Windows 10, etc.) 

- Browser and version (e.g. Chrome 71, Firefox 65, etc.)

- Devices/emulators affected 

- Stack trace/error logs - Any error messages or stack traces logged by the system.

- tester/reporter - Name and contact info of person reporting the bug.

Labels/tags - Categorization of the type of bug, e.g. "UI", "crash", "security", etc.

Reference material - Links to any specifications or screenshots that might help explain the intended functionality.

Reproducibility - An indication of how reliably the bug can be reproduced, e.g. "happens every time", "have not been able to reproduce" etc.

Severity/priority - An assessment of the urgency and impact of fixing this bug. This helps prioritize which bugs should be fixed first.

A well-written bug report contains all the details required to both understand and reproduce the bug, allowing developers to efficiently diagnose the problem and implement a fix.


## speaking about software quality assurance, what does a bug report consist of? what fields should it have? generate professional comprehensive explanation

Here is a professional comprehensive explanation of what a bug report should consist of and the key fields it should have:

A bug report is a document that records the details of a software bug or defect discovered during testing. A good bug report provides all the information required for a developer to understand and reproduce the issue in order to fix it. The key fields a comprehensive bug report should include are:

Summary - A short one line summary of the bug. Example: "Application crashes when clicking Submit button on registration form" 

Description - A detailed narrative describing the bug, including steps to reproduce it, expected vs actual results, and other observable symptoms. 

Steps to Reproduce - A numbered list of steps outlining the exact steps taken to make the bug appear. This is one of the most important sections.

Expected Result - What should happen when the steps are followed.

Actual Result - What actually happened when the steps were followed. 

Screenshots - Screen captures demonstrating the bug provide helpful visual context.

Test Data - Any data that was used when reproducing the bug, such as input values entered into a form.

Environment Details - Details like operating system, browser and version, device used, database, etc. Helpful debugging info.

Severity - Indicates how severe or detrimental the bug is. Common values are Critical, High, Medium, Low.

Priority - Indicates the importance of fixing the bug. High, Medium, and Low are common values.

Status - The current status of the bug report - New, Confirmed, In Progress, Fixed, etc.

Attachments - Files attached to the report like screenshots, videos, error logs, etc. 

Comments - Running commentary capturing clarifications, additional info, status updates, etc.

The above details provide development teams with an accurate, reproducible account of the bug in order to diagnose and resolve it efficiently. A well-written bug report is critical to effective quality assurance and bug tracking.
