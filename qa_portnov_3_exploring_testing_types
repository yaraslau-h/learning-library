# 1 what is functionality (not functional) testing?

## 1.1 i am preparing for an interview on junior software qa engineer position, and need your help with answering a few questions. what is functionality (not functional) testing? generate professional detailed explanation

Here is a detailed explanation of what functionality (not functional) testing is:

Functionality testing, also known as non-functional testing, focuses on evaluating how well the functions of a software application work from the end user's perspective. It is different from functional testing, which verifies that specific functions meet their intended design and work as expected. 

The goal of functionality testing is to evaluate broader quality attributes of the system that are important to the end user, such as usability, performance efficiency, reliability, and security. Some examples of what would be tested in functionality testing include:

- Usability testing - Testing how easy or intuitive the application is to use. This includes checking the user interface design, workflow, accessibility, and documentation quality.

- Performance testing - Testing how fast the application responds to user actions or can handle a certain user load. This helps identify bottlenecks.

- Load testing - Testing how the application handles increasing usage levels. The goal is to verify it can maintain performance under expected real-world use.

- Stress testing - Testing how the application functions under extreme workloads or peak conditions, beyond what would be expected in normal use. 

- Reliability testing - Testing how consistently the application functions over time, without crashing or displaying errors.

- Security testing - Testing how resistant the application is against unauthorized access or hacking attempts.

While functional testing focuses on verifying the correctness of specific features and code modules, functionality testing takes a broader view to evaluate quality attributes that impact the end-user experience. Well-rounded testing includes both functional and non-functional testing. Functionality testing provides confidence that the overall system works properly under real-world conditions.




# 2 what is regression testing?

## 2.1 i am preparing for an interview on junior software qa engineer position, and need your help with answering a few questions. what is regression testing? generate professional detailed explanation

Here is a detailed explanation of regression testing:

Regression testing is a software testing technique that validates whether changes to an application have introduced new faults or bugs. The goal of regression testing is to ensure that existing and previously tested functionality still works as expected after changes have been made. 

Some key points about regression testing:

- It is performed after modifications like enhancements, defect fixes or configuration changes have been made to software to confirm previously working functionality has not been impacted.

- It focuses on validating existing and unchanged functionality has not been affected by the changes. New functionality is usually tested separately through new tests.

- Regression tests are typically automated to allow efficient and repeated execution. Automation helps quickly test the system after any changes to ensure no regressions were introduced.

- A baseline set of regression tests are maintained covering critical and high risk functionality. These are executed after any major changes or periodically.

- Regression testing provides confidence that changes have not created unintended side effects. It helps detect bugs early and ensures software quality. 

- It is an important discipline in software testing since changes can easily render previously working functionality defective. Performing regression testing is essential to ensure software continues to work correctly.

In summary, regression testing is re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure existing functionality still works as expected after changes. It is an important testing technique to verify no new issues have been introduced and the system remains stable.




# 3 what is performance testing?

Here is a detailed explanation of performance testing:

Performance testing is a type of software testing that focuses on how a system or application performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload. The main goal of performance testing is to identify and resolve any bottlenecks, issues or weaknesses in a system that impact its speed, scalability, and stability under real-world user conditions.

Some key aspects of performance testing include:

- Load Testing: Testing application performance when multiple users access the system concurrently to simulate real-world traffic. This helps identify maximum operating capacity and any bottlenecks under heavy loads.

- Stress Testing: Testing application stability and reliability under extreme workloads beyond normal operational capacity to see how it handles high volumes. This reveals breaking points.

- Spike Testing: Suddenly increasing users or load on the system and then bringing back down to normal levels. Checks application reliability with sudden large spikes in traffic.

- Endurance Testing: Testing application performance over an extended period of time to verify it can sustain continuous expected load. Uncovers memory leaks or degradation issues.

- Scalability Testing: Testing performance when system resources like database, servers or hardware are scaled up or down. Verifies linear scalability and robustness under dynamic system changes.

The process involves simulating expected real-world usage conditions, defining key performance metrics like response time, throughput, resource usage, etc., setting up monitoring tools, executing tests, and analyzing results to identify optimizations. 

Performance testing requires expertise in tools like JMeter, Gatling, NeoLoad, preparation of test data, scripts, running tests across different environments, analyzing reports and logs to detect issues for fixing. It plays a key role in delivering high-quality software optimized for end users.
